# Collaboration

All projects are automatically grouped under an Organization. Organizations make it easy to share groups of projects
between users.

When you signup for Vapor Cloud, you need to create your first organization.

::: tip Info
On Vapor Cloud you can create unlimited organizations, and organizations can have as many members as you want.

## Recommended setup

It is always recommended to try to split your systems up into different organizations, this makes for better
separation of systems.

It is always possible to transfer an application from one organization to another.
